    <h1>Voter Registration Age Verification Tool</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Brief Preface:</h2>
    <p>In the United States, no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election.<br>
        According to the U.S. Constitution, voting is a right and a privilege.<br>
        While many constitutional amendments have been ratified since the first election,<br>
        none of them made voting mandatory for U.S. citizens.</p>

    <p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"> Even though voting is a right and a privilege - to participate in
        the
        election
        process of your local, state,<br>
        and federal government, there are a few basic requirements that must be met...<br>
        <br></p>
    <h3>The Voter Registration Requirements for The United States of America are as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To register you must be a citizen of the United States</li><br>
        <li>To vote on state issue the State's residency requirements must be met.<br>
            This can vary by state. (You can be homeless and still meet these requirements.)</li><br>
        <li>Voter must be 18 years old on or before Election Day. (Pre-registration ages vary by state,<br>
            but you must be 18 years old to vote and in some state you must be 18 before the election)</li><br>
        <li>It is the sole responsibility of the voter fulfill all of the requirements of the state before the
            specified deadline.<br>
            (If you don't register in time, you don't get to vote!)</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>The Voter Registration Age Verification Tool will verify that the registrant is at least 18 years old, based
        on the user input,<br> and then alert the registrant if they meet the required minimum age criteria and are able
        to
        vote according to the calculation.<br><br>
