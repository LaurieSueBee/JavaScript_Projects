        <h1>Voter Registration Age Verification Tool</h1>
<br>
<h2>Brief Preface:</h2>
<p>In the United States, no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election.<br>
   According to the U.S. Constitution, voting is a right and a privilege.<br>
   While many constitutional amendments have been ratified since the first election,<br>
   none of them made voting mandatory for U.S. citizens.</p>

<h3>Even though voting is a right and a privilege, to participate in the election process of your local, state,<br>
    and federal government, there are a few basic requirements that must be met...<br>
<br>    
<h3>The Voter Registration Requirenments for The United States of America are as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
         <li>To register you must be a citizen of the United States</li><br>
         <li>To vote on state issue the State's residency requirements must be met.<br>
             This can vary by state. (You can be homeless and still meet these requirements.)</li><br>
         <li>Voter must be 18 years old on or before Election Day. (Pre-registration ages vary by state,<br>
             but you must be 18 years old to vote and in some state you must be 18 before the election)</li><br>
         <li>It is the sole responsibility of the voter fullfill all of the requirements of the state before the specified deadline.(If you  dont't register in time, you don't get to vote!)</li>
     </ul>
 </p>
</h3>
<p>This program will verify the age of each registrant.
   This verification technique requires the voter to follow a few simple instructions which include entering their legal name and date of birth into the specified fields.<br>
   Voter Registration Age Calculation Tool facilitates the verification and accurate calculation of the registered voters age</p>
   Thereby insuring that the person voting meets the minimum requirement of 18 years of age.</p>
