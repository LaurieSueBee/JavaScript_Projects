    <p>Is it time to schedule your patient's yearly eye exam? --<br>
      <br>This is a demo of a new tool available for immediate use in Optometry Clinics : <br><br>
      Introducing... <br>The Function amEyeLate();<br>
      and its counterpart function... amEyeLateProtocol()<br><br>
      <br> This function will take the date of your patient's last eye exam and project a
      year forward to when the patient's next eye exam is due.<br>
      <br> It will notify the office staff a month ahead of time and prompt the staff to
      take action and mail a reminder with a 15% off coupon to the patient.<br>
      <br> It will also take into consideration that if the action is not handled before
      2:00pm of that business day it will not be reflected as handled until the following
      business day (due to the time needed to process the reminder and get it ready to for
      the postal service).<br>
      <br>Finally, the function will instruct the staff to follow up with the patient 14
      days after the reminder was mailed . This will provide further assistance to the
      patient in case they need help with scheduling the yearly Eye Exam. This is a
      courtesy call to the patients from which no reply has been received after 14
      days.<br>
      <br>The implementation of these procedures should increase the number of recurring
      yearly eye exam and in turn, increase the percentage of doctors whose practices are
      in compliance with the preventative wellness check best practice recommendations as
      recently passed by the National Board of Optometry.</p>
    <br>
    <br>So -- without further a-do... Here is the amEyeLate() Function in action!<br><br>

    <p>SCENARIO:<br>
      How long has it been since Martha Saunders was in for an eye exam? <br>Has it really been THAT
      long??<br>
      Could it be longer than you think???<br>
      Has a full year gone by and Mrs. Saunders hasn't been scheduled for her yearly exam????<br>
      I looks like someone IS LATE,.. and it is NOT Mrs. Saunders. It's YOU!!!<p>

        <br>
        <p>BACKGROUND INFO:<br>
          Let's assume that Mrs. Saunders last eye exam was March 3rd,
          2019.
          <br> This information was obtained from the office management system software and database
          records at your clinic...<p>

            <p>The Following preemptive task module executes the recommended
              procedure to insure the successful implementation of Best
              Practice
              Procedures to increase the overall health and well-being of the
              patient through preventive medicine, while striving to strengthen
              doctor / patient relations. Preventive medicine offers a unique opportunity to build
              patient / doctor relationships. Through education, kindness, and compassion,
              preventive medicine will build trust and bridge the communication gap between both,
              the physician and patient .<br>
              <br><br>
              THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THIS : <br>
              Timely wellness checks, the foundation blocks of preventive
              medicine, are key to early detection and treatment of many major
              health issues.<br>
              <br>
              A person's eye can reveal much more to a physician than simply
              the quality of their vision...
              <br><br>
              Here is a list of health issues that can be detected from an eye
              exam:
              <ul>
                <li>Diabetes: If a doctor looks into your eyes and sees hemorrhaging, you may have
                  diabetes</li>
                <li>High blood pressure: Torn or bent eye blood vessels could show high blood
                  pressure</li>
                <li>Arthritis: Inflammation of the sclera or uvea could signal arthritis</li>
                <li>Cancer: Abnormal eye structure could signal cancer</li>
                <li>Tumors: Pupils that have developed an irregular shape could be a tumor</li>
                <li>High Cholesterol: Yellow appearance around the cornea or plaque filled retina
                  blood vessels may show high cholesterol</li>
                <li>Thyroid disease: Bulging eyes can be a sign of thyroid issues</li>
                <li>Autoimmune diseases: Inflammation of the optic nerve could be a sign of multiple
                  sclerosis or lupus</li>
                <li>Blood clotting disorder: Optic nerve swelling could signal an issue with blood
                  clotting</li>
                <li>Some recent research has even started showing that eye exams can provide early
                  diagnosis of autism in children.</li>
              </ul>
              So yes, an eye exam is an exam for the eyes â€“ but they are also an exam for your
              entire body.</li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              The National Board of Optometry strongly urges all Optometry practices to implement
              the amEyeLate() function and amEyeLateProtocol() function into your office task
              management system today!!!<br><br><br>
              Remember this:<br>
              It's not only a matter of saving eyes , ... it's a matter of saving lives!
