    <p>Is it time to schedule your patient's yearly eye exam? --<br>
      <br>This is a demo of a new tool available for immediate use in Optometry Clinics : <br><br>
      Introducing... <br>The Am_Eye_Late() Function;<br>
    
      <br> The Am_Eye_Late() function takes the date of the patient's last eye exam then figures when <br>
      the ideal date for the next eye exam should be. In this instance, the ideal date for the next <br>
      "yearly" eye exam would be 365 days out from the date of the last eye exam --<br>
       a.k.a. one year into the future, or better yet...next year!<br>
      <br> After the date of our future eye exam is pinned down, we need to have a plan in place to maximize the patient<br>
       return service rate. The framework for this plan, or protocol, provides a clear and concise means to produce a<br>
       greater patient /client relationship while maintaining a steady, predictable workflow <br>
      and and increasing the productivity and organization of you staff and  office protocols and procedures.<br>
      Having a well thought out plan of action that is easy to implement, easy to replicate, and easy to maintain<br>
      are the key factors that determine the level of impact that is possible. The functionality that Am_Eye_Late() <br>
      brings to the practice is measurable in monetary gains, increased staff performance levels, and patient<br>
      satisfaction. One month before the the next Yearly Eye Exam (30 days), the program will alert the staff to mail a reminder,<br>
      to Patient"X" to contact the office because iit is time for the yearly eye exam. An incentive discount offer is also available<br>
      to include with the reminder. The staff will mail the reminder to the patient. The next step, occurs at the 2 week mark (14 days after the reminder is mailed).<br>
      If the office has not received a R.S.V.P from the patient to schedule the eye exam, it is time to make phone contact.<br>
      The system will prompt the staff to proceed with a courtesy call to see if they need any assistance with making the appointment for the yearly eye exam<br>
      This greatly increases the probability that Mr. and/or  Mrs. "Patient", do indeed make it to their next yearly eye exam...and that they do so in a timely manner.
      <br><br>Finally, the function will instruct the staff to follow up with the patient 14
      days after the reminder was mailed . This will provide further assistance to the
      patient in case they need help with scheduling the yearly Eye Exam. This is a
      courtesy call to reach out and make personal contact if the office has not yet received a response to the mail out reminder.
      <br>The implementation of these procedures should increase the number of recurring
      yearly eye exam, and in turn, increase the percentage of doctors whose practices are
      in compliance with the preventative wellness check best practice recommendations as
      recently passed by the National Board of Optometry.</p>
       <br><br>    
             <p>The main objective is to increase the overall health and well-being of patients
              through preventive medicine( timely wellness check-ups). The members of the <br>
              National Board of Optometry believe that this new emphasis on preventive care <br>
              provides a  perfect place and time for the field of Optometry to step up and <br>
              assume a more active role in patient primary care. Our goal is to start a study <br>
              and prove that the field of Optometry can , and should be utilized in a more effective manner<br>
              by taking a closer look at the health information that can be gleaned from a simple eye examination,<br>
              and how that information should be used in a more beneficial way to increase the longevity and<br>
              quality of life for all patients. The field of Optometry will be a breath of fresh air and re-define<br>
              "preventive medicine". As of late, the term of "preventive medicine" has become almost trendy...tossed around here and there<br>
              -it's something that we read about on the covers of magazines, it's a cliche` amongst professionals at high-end spas<br>
              and private personal trainers at five star gyms. Preventive medicine is so fashionable it can be served with mimosas at brunch!.<br>
              Preventive medicine is MORE than fashionable.Through the collective efforts of healthcare providers, early detection of disease and illness is saving lives.<br>
              Preventive Medicine is going mainstream--everyone deserves the benefits that come from preventive care.<br> 
              Preventive medicine is to be the foundation of all medical treatment plans. It's been there all along right there in front of us,<br>
              if only we had the eyes to see it? ...Well, now we do. We have seen the future of Health Care and it looks Bright!<br>
            <br><br>
            <p style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold;">THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THIS : <br>
              Timely wellness checks, the foundation blocks of preventive
              medicine, are key to early detection and treatment of many major
              health issues.<br>The info obtained during these wellness
              checks will be shared with the patient's "team of healthcare providers". This
              open-ness will enable us to detect potential health risks earlier than we have ever been able to before,
              and implement treatment to remedy these issues, if there are any to address. Through education,
              kindness, compassion,mutual respect and teamwork;
              preventive medicine will serve as a powerful tool in the early detection of disease or
              any change in a patient's health markers, while also bridging the communication gap
              between the patient and the members of the health care team, the likes of which we have never seen. </p><br>

              The eye can reveal much more than simply
              the quality of their vision...
              <br><br>
              Here is a list of health issues that can be detected from an eye
              exam:</p>
              <ul style="color:black;font-weight:bold; ">
                <li>Diabetes: If a doctor looks into your eyes and sees hemorrhaging, you may have
                  diabetes</li><br>
                <li>High blood pressure: Torn or bent eye blood vessels could show high blood
                  pressure</li><br>
                <li>Arthritis: Inflammation of the sclera or uvea could signal arthritis</li><br>
                <li>Cancer: Abnormal eye structure could signal cancer</li><br>
                <li>Tumors: Pupils that have developed an irregular shape could be a tumor</li><br>
                <li>High Cholesterol: Yellow appearance around the cornea or plaque filled retina
                  blood vessels may show high cholesterol</li><br>
                <li>Thyroid disease: Bulging eyes can be a sign of thyroid issues</li><br>
                <li>Autoimmune diseases: Inflammation of the optic nerve could be a sign of multiple
                  sclerosis or lupus</li><br>
                <li>Blood clotting disorder: Optic nerve swelling could signal an issue with blood
                  clotting</li><br>
                <li>Some recent research has even started showing that eye exams can provide early
                  diagnosis of autism in children.</li>
              </ul><cite></cite>
